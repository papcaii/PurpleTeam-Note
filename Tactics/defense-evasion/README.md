# Defense Evasion

Defense Evasion refers to tactics used by attackers to avoid detection and bypass security measures during their cyberattacks.
There are some of attackers behaviors:
- hide attacker (payload, malware, ...) activities
- avoid triggering security alerts
- evade the detection of their malicious actions

In this context, I will cover some techniques that I think is effective !

## AV Bypass

### Why 
Obviously in the client's system always have protection, one of those is Anti-Virus, like:
- Kaspersky Antivirus
- Bitdefender Antivirus
- Windows Defender
- ...

So if we can bypass these it would be easier for us to do malicious things

### Mechanism
Yeah, reverse :)) The first step when exploit is understand how our target work.
As I know
