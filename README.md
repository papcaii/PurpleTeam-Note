## What is Purple Teaming?

Purple Teaming is a collaborative approach to cybersecurity that brings together Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) expertise. By working together, simulating attacks, and sharing insights, Purple Teams aim to:

*   **Improve Detection and Response:** Enhance the organization's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks.
*   **Bridge the Gap:** Facilitate communication and understanding between offensive and defensive teams.
*   **Optimize Security Controls:** Identify weaknesses in security controls and processes, and recommend improvements.
*   **Promote Proactive Security:** Shift from a reactive to a more proactive security posture.
*   **Enhance Threat Intelligence:** Develop a deeper understanding of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several key areas, each focusing on a different aspect of Purple Team skills:

*   **[Adversary Emulation](./Adversary):**  This section focuses on adversary emulation, including planning, execution, and analysis of simulated attacks. It covers frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and tools like CALDERA.

*   **[MITRE Tactics](./Tactics):** This section provides useful techniques based on MITRE tactics
